# Ordy

**The AI waiter that understands, talks, and takes action.**

Ordy is an API-first, autonomous AI voice agent platform for restaurants. Customers hold natural voice conversations — in English, French, or Tunisian Derja — to order food, book tables, check availability, and get answers. Restaurants connect their website, database, POS, API, or repository; Ordy learns their menu, hours, and policies, then acts on their systems through a secure, audited tool-execution layer.

> **Status: Phase 7 — Order execution (in progress) 🎯 the sellable milestone.** Phases 1–6 are complete: architecture ([docs/](docs/)), auth/tenancy/menu on **RLS** ([docs/PHASE-2.md](docs/PHASE-2.md)), ingestion ([docs/PHASE-3.md](docs/PHASE-3.md)), knowledge/RAG on pgvector ([docs/PHASE-4.md](docs/PHASE-4.md)), the conversational agent ([docs/PHASE-5.md](docs/PHASE-5.md)), and the deterministic **action gate** ([docs/PHASE-6.md](docs/PHASE-6.md)). Phase 7 makes confirmed plans real — `ordy-orders` (state machines, timezone-aware hours incl. midnight spans, delivery zones, clamped totals), a DB-backed native adapter writing orders with idempotent replay, **fallback to Ordy's own store when an integration is down so orders are never lost**, compensation on multi-step failure, the Action Provider conformance runner, signed webhooks, and a live operations dashboard. **80 tests pass** ([docs/PHASE-7.md](docs/PHASE-7.md)).

## The one rule that shapes everything

The LLM never touches a database, an API, or a browser directly.

```
Conversation → Understanding → Planning → Validation → Action → Confirmation

        LLM ──► Intent + Tool Call ──► Policy Engine ──► Validation Layer
                                                              │
        Restaurant System ◄── Secure Executor ◄───────────────┘
```

Every state-changing operation passes through a typed tool schema, a deterministic policy engine, a validation layer, and an audited executor. The model proposes; the platform disposes.
